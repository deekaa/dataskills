## What is data science?

-   Term that emerged ca. 10 years ago. Predecessors: Statistics, Data analysis.

-   The science of creating valuable information from data

-   Practice-oriented science

-   Combines technical and field expertise

## How can data science benefit social work?

-   Use cases in social work

    -   [Identify demand for social work among potential clients](https://arbor.bfh.ch/19212/)

    -   [Measure and prove the effectiveness of social work](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=87d6833ec738372fJmltdHM9MTcwMjUxMjAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xYWFkNTE1Yi1mY2I0LTY0MDUtMjllMC00MmJjZmRiZjY1MTYmaW5zaWQ9NTIyMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=1aad515b-fcb4-6405-29e0-42bcfdbf6516&psq=Analyse+zu+den+Auswirkungen+der+Reduktion+der+Fallbelastung+in+der+Sozialberatung+der+Stadt+Winterthur&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGFkdC53aW50ZXJ0aHVyLmNoL2dlbWVpbmRlL3ZlcndhbHR1bmcvc296aWFsZXMvc296aWFsZS1kaWVuc3RlL2JlcmljaHRlLXVuZC1zdHVkaWVuL2Jhc3NfcmVkdWt0aW9uX2ZhbGxsYXN0X3dpbnRlcnRodXJfc2NobHVzc2JlcmljaHRfMjAyMV8wNy5wZGYvZG93bmxvYWQ&ntb=1)

## Excercise

-   Think of a social work field

-   What is the goal of social work in that field: What aspects of your clients lives do you want to improve?

-   What existing data could you use to measure these aspects of your clients’ lives? Who owns the data? What specific information would you use to measure this? What are technical and ethical limitations?

# Measuring the effects of social work

## Why is it important to measure the effects of social work?

-   Improving practice with better knowledge

    -   Understanding whether and how social work interventions and offers reach their goals (evaluation)

    -   Knowing the most effective interventions and offers

    -   Knowing the most cost-effective interventions and offers

-   Legitimizing social work

    -   Gaining political support for social work (i.e. money!)
    -   Example:
        -   [Winterthur](https://www.buerobass.ch/fileadmin/Files/2021/2021_Reduktion_Falllast_Winterthur_Schlussbericht_DE.pdf)

## What is an effect and what not?

-   Effect = difference in the result with influencing variable versus without influencing variable (= **counterfactual** situation)

-   What is the counterfactual situation?

    -   The story of Tom and Eva

        -   "Eva was a saleswoman in a supermarket in Lucerne, who came from a poor family. She dropped out of school after the ninth grade to financially support her parents. In 2005, she met Tom, a mechanic from St. Gallen who worked in a workshop. They fell in love and got married in 2007. They had two children: a son named Max in 2008 and a daughter named Zoe in 2010.

            Eva and Tom had a loving marriage but also their problems. They had to deal with the low income, high rent, and high cost of living. They sometimes argued, but they always talked it out and found a solution. They valued each other and supported each other's wishes.

            However, in 2017, the relationship between Eva and Tom broke down. Eva discovered that Tom was having an affair with a customer he had met in his workshop. She was angry and hurt and confronted him about it. Tom admitted his infidelity and told her that he no longer loved her. He wanted a divorce and to move out.

            Eva was devastated and agreed to the divorce. They had to arrange custody for their children, who suffered from their parents' separation. They decided on joint custody, with the children alternating between living with each parent. They also had to divide the assets they had accumulated during their marriage. They sold their apartment in Lucerne and split the proceeds.

            Today, Eva and Tom are divorced and live separately. They have both continued their careers but with less success than before. Eva is still a saleswoman in a small supermarket but has no prospects for promotion or salary increase. Tom is still a mechanic in a small workshop but faces a lot of competition from younger colleagues. They earn less money than before and have trouble paying their bills. They also have less time for themselves and for their children, who are unhappy and insecure. Since 2020, Eva has been supported by social welfare."

    -   The counterfactual version

        -   "Eva was a saleswoman in a supermarket in Lucerne, who came from a poor family. She dropped out of school after the ninth grade to financially support her parents. In 2005, she met Tom, a mechanic from St. Gallen who worked in a workshop. They fell in love and got married in 2007. They had two children: a son named Max in 2008 and a daughter named Zoe in 2010.

            Eva and Tom had a loving marriage but also their problems. They had to deal with the low income, high rent, and high cost of living. They sometimes argued, but they always talked it out and found a solution. They valued each other and supported each other's wishes.

            In 2017, Eva found a job as a cashier in a larger supermarket, while Tom continued to work in the workshop. They earned more money and were able to buy their own apartment. They also had more time for themselves and for their children, who were happy and healthy. Today, Eva and Tom are still happily married and looking forward to the future. They plan to take a trip to Spain soon to enjoy the sun. They also hope to become grandparents one day, as their son Max has a lovely girlfriend whom he has been dating for six months. Their daughter Zoe is still at school, but she already has many talents and interests that she wants to pursue."

    color = "Effect", 
    y = "Life Satisfaction resp.\nEffect of Divorce on Life Satisfaction"

    -   [![](images/clipboard-851415407.png)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30405)

-   A bad example of the effects of social work

    -   [Federal Council guidelines for the labor market integration of persons with protection status S for cantons: 40% should have a job until the end of 2024](https://www.blick.ch/politik/40-prozent-sollen-stelle-haben-der-bundesrat-will-dass-mehr-ukrainerinnen-arbeiten-id19105587.html)

## How can we measure the effects of social work with quantitative data?

### Asking experts

-   "Do you think this course makes you a better social worker?"

-   Advantages

    -   Easy to measure

    -   Subjective expertise: we know a lot about effects (e.g. pain killers)

-   Disadvantages

    -   We are unaware of the counterfactual

    -   Social desirability bias

### Assessing correlations

### Experiments - the gold standard

### Natural experiments

## Exercise in R
